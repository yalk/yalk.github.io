about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I help brands quantify and optimize the impact of their digital marketing campaigns. 
  
  Outside of work, I love to travel and learn about different cultures and their cuisines.

  When I am not working or traveling, I am either trying out new coffee beans or riding my motorcycle around the city.
